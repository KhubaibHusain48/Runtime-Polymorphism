# Runtime Polymorphism in Java

## Description

This project demonstrates the concept of **runtime polymorphism** (also known as dynamic method dispatch) in Java using a simple example of animals making sounds. It highlights how method overriding allows Java to decide at runtime which method to execute based on the object type rather than the reference type.

## Features

* Shows the use of inheritance and method overriding.
* Demonstrates runtime polymorphism with an `Animal` superclass and `Dog` and `Cat` subclasses.
* Simple and clear console output illustrating dynamic method dispatch.

## Code Structure

* `Animal` class: Base class with a generic `sound()` method.
* `Dog` class: Subclass overriding `sound()` method to print "Dog sound".
* `Cat` class: Subclass overriding `sound()` method to print "Cat sound".
* `RuntimePolymorphism` class: Contains the `main` method where polymorphism is demonstrated by creating `Animal` references to `Dog` and `Cat` objects.

## How to Run

1. Compile all the classes:

   ```
   javac ConceptsCode/Polymorphism/*.java
   ```
2. Run the main class:

   ```
   java ConceptsCode.Polymorphism.RuntimePolymorphism
   ```
3. Observe the output:

   ```
   Dog sound
   Cat sound
   ```

## Requirements

* Java JDK installed (version 8 or above recommended)
* Basic understanding of Java inheritance and polymorphism concepts
